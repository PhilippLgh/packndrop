Pack'N'Drop makes it easy to load packages with resources into memory, verify them on a package-level and serve them as individual trusted resources.
This library includes the tools to use packages for example in custom protocols, display a website from a tar or zip file, inject them in webviews, iframes or use them in service workers.
